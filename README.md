This script, named "Scalpgorithm By SamFx," is a custom-built technical analysis indicator designed to identify and visualize trendline breakouts across multiple timeframes in a market chart. It combines trendline analysis with multi-timeframe signals, providing traders with an advanced tool for scalp trading strategies. The core features and functionality are outlined as follows:

Key Features:
1. Trendline Detection & Visualization:
   - The indicator automatically detects swing highs and lows using a configurable lookback period (length). These pivots are used to plot trendlines that represent the upper and lower bounds of price movement.
   - Trendlines are drawn dynamically, updating as new swing points are detected, and are extended forward to provide a clear view of the market structure.
   - Trendline colors are customizable, allowing traders to define colors for uptrend and downtrend lines (upCss and dnCss).

2. Slope Calculation Methods:
   - The script offers three different methods for calculating the slope of the trendlines:
     - ATR (Average True Range): Calculates the slope based on volatility.
     - Stdev (Standard Deviation): Measures the variability of price, adjusting trendline slope accordingly.
     - Linreg (Linear Regression): Uses linear regression to calculate the slope, giving a more statistically driven approach.
   - These methods are controlled by the user, providing flexibility for traders to adapt the indicator to different market conditions.

3. Trendline Breakout Detection:
   - The script identifies when price breaks through an established trendline, triggering a visual signal on the chart.
   - A label is plotted at the breakout point, providing an instant visual cue for the trader. The label indicates "B" for breakout, with upward or downward arrows based on the trend direction.

4. Multi-Timeframe Analysis:
   - The indicator evaluates multiple timeframes, including 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute, 30-minute, and 1-hour charts.
   - It retrieves the breakout signals from each timeframe and displays them in a table located at the top-right corner of the chart. Each row in the table shows the signal for a given timeframe, indicating whether the market is in an upward, downward, or neutral trend.
   - The table dynamically updates with the most recent signals from each timeframe, enabling traders to quickly assess the broader market context.

5. Alert System:
   - Alerts are triggered whenever a trendline breakout occurs, with specific conditions for both upward and downward breakouts.
   - Alerts are configurable, ensuring that traders can be notified in real-time when a breakout happens, allowing for quicker decision-making.

Customization:
- Swing Detection Lookback (length): This parameter controls the lookback period for detecting pivot points, giving traders the ability to fine-tune the sensitivity of the trendline detection.
- Slope Multiplier (mult): Adjusts the steepness of the trendlines, allowing the trader to customize how aggressive or conservative the trendlines should be.
- Slope Calculation Method (calcMethod): Traders can choose from ATR, Stdev, or Linreg methods for trendline slope calculation, offering flexibility based on trading preferences or market conditions.
- Visual Style: Traders can modify the trendline colors (upCss, dnCss) and adjust the extension of the trendlines to suit their visual preferences and trading style.

Practical Application:
This indicator is particularly useful for scalpers and short-term traders who rely on quick trend shifts and breakout patterns. By integrating multi-timeframe signals, it offers a more comprehensive view of market movements, helping traders make informed decisions based on both short-term and longer-term trend developments.

In conclusion, "Scalpgorithm By SamFx" is a powerful and versatile trading tool that combines trendline analysis, breakout detection, and multi-timeframe evaluation, making it ideal for traders looking for an edge in fast-paced markets. Its customization options allow it to be adapted to a wide variety of trading strategies, and its visual and alert-based system ensures that traders can react swiftly to market changes.
