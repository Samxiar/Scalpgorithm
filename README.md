This is a series of Financial Algorithms based on Technical Analysis, designed for scalping. With a risk-to-reward ratio of 1:2/1:3, the algorithms aim to generate consistent profits by identifying high-probability short-term trades. Focused on precision and quick market movements, these algorithms strive to maximize returns while managing risk effectively.
